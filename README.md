# Data-driven-analysis-for-reducing-dropout-rates.
This project could help government bodies and NGOs understand the dropout problem better and take effective action. By identifying students at risk and providing timely support, this study aims to reduce dropout rates and ensure more students complete their education. This will not only benefit individual students but also strengthen society by creating a more skilled and educatedÂ workforce.
